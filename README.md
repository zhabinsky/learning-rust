# learning-rust

## What's this repo for?

Here I will store my RUST projects for as long as I am learning and experimenting with it on a low scale. Here I will collect all the theoretical stuff I write down while learning and any useful resources or examples.

My ambition to try out going into the wild with a lower level language was hugely influences by this particular [post](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/intro-to-web-programming-in-rust-for-nodejs-developers-1a9c048c4de1). Where it said:

```
Rust is different. You can pick up Python or Ruby over the weekend, create a first CRUD application and be happy with the results.

With Rustâ€¦ with Rust you will struggle to pass a String to a different method, change and return it. You then will order the Rust book, see its size, *sigh* and get started.
```

## Helper scripts

For better learning experience I will collect debugging and development scripts here as well. Available commands:

- compile and run   
```
$ npm start ./docs-examples/hello-world.rs
```
- TODO: watch: compile and run   
```
$ npm start ./docs-examples/hello-world.rs --watch
```
